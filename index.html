<h2>Weaver Warriors take down Stuyvesant Slingers 44-42!</h2>

They put up a good fight today, however, on the back of temporary replacement Dimitris Markopolous' shooting performance. With elite shooting from Ethan Glassman, combined with good performances from Aaron Bard and Julian Epstein the Warriors managed to pull out the win.</p>
